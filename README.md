# Red-black trees based algorithm for a social network like problem
Developed with the C language an algorithm which,using Red-Black trees and other common data structes such as linked-lists, manages the creation of entities and relationships between them like an algorithm used in a social network would do. Got the maximum grade possible (30 cum laude/30) by achieving the best time and space complexity constraints among the ones proposed.

Developed as part of the BSc thesis for an Algorithms and Data Structures class.
